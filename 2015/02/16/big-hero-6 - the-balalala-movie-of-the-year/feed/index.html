		<description><![CDATA[Kudos for this article!

Whereas I was there at the time of watching the movie, I had skipped reading this piece, thinking it wouldn&#039;t add anything.
I was dead wrong! You actually pointed things out I hadn&#039;t realised yet. And that doesn&#039;t happen very often. (Although Disney is making a habit of doing it this way, &#039;hiding&#039; little details and huge themes in a movie :)  )]]></description>
