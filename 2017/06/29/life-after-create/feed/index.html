		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dennis,

I think you at least missed out on a few companies next to Saab and ABN-AMRO. Bob Loos, even featuring one of your pictures as (as far as I know) quite content at Nedap. 

Personally I still do believe to a certain extent in the job-opportunities of CreaTe (even though I am still in the academic rat-race myself). It does, however, depend a bit more on your skill-set and interests than other studies. Especially because CreaTe is such a broad study you have not been formed into this puzzle piece that will fit exactly with certain vacancies, but chances are you didn&#039;t want to be that puzzle piece for starters. So what are the skills you feel comfortable employing, and what are the hopes you have for a future career?

Also, keep in mind we are of a generation full of hope. The generation that genuinely believed for a second they could be the new Steve Jobs. This while most jobs are just a bit more boring, consider for your self could you be content working in less prestigious roles? You just have to take a short look on vacancy websites and you can see the big demand for anyone even remotely interested in working in IT. Consider for example the traineeships from Calco (https://www.werkenbijcalco.nl/starters/traineeship-calco-masterclass) which are specifically oriented at re-educating people without IT background to go into IT. Then certainly CreaTe must provide some opportunities as well. 

While I am certainly sensitive for you struggles in discovering your future (I for one still am struggling), I think you discussion of career options would have been more fruitful with specified skills and/or interests. 

Cheers, 
Duuk]]></description>
