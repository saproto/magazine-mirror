		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dennis,

I think you at least missed out on a few companies next to Saab and ABN-AMRO. Bob Loos, even featuring one of your pictures as (as far as I know) quite content at Nedap. 

Personally I still do believe to a certain extent in the job-opportunities of CreaTe (even though I am still in the academic rat-race myself). It does, however, depend a bit more on your skill-set and interests than other studies. Especially because CreaTe is such a broad study you have not been formed into this puzzle piece that will fit exactly with certain vacancies, but chances are you didn&#039;t want to be that puzzle piece for starters. So what are the skills you feel comfortable employing, and what are the hopes you have for a future career?

Also, keep in mind we are of a generation full of hope. The generation that genuinely believed for a second they could be the new Steve Jobs. This while most jobs are just a bit more boring, consider for your self could you be content working in less prestigious roles? You just have to take a short look on vacancy websites and you can see the big demand for anyone even remotely interested in working in IT. Consider for example the traineeships from Calco (https://www.werkenbijcalco.nl/starters/traineeship-calco-masterclass) which are specifically oriented at re-educating people without IT background to go into IT. Then certainly CreaTe must provide some opportunities as well. 

While I am certainly sensitive for you struggles in discovering your future (I for one still am struggling), I think you discussion of career options would have been more fruitful with specified skills and/or interests. 

Cheers, 
Duuk]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another awesome create movie, as quite a few of us believe it to be, is Big Hero 6. Mix in gadgets, robotics and science-fiction-like mechanics, a fight vetween good and evil and discover the consequences technology might have. 
A compelling animation with, action, humor and lots of easter eggs.

This person makes sure the group doesn&#039;t start any later than 8:45 using arguments like &quot;We have to start early because I want to have a good product at the end&quot;, and will relentlessly complain about everybody showing up at 8:46 or later. As the first miscommunications occur, this person knows exactly who&#039;s fault it is and will use any means to make clear that it was a big, big error. They are also the first to ask for a Yellow Card, discard members of the group completely or exit the group themselves. At the end of the project, a quick assessment of who-did-what shows that this person did remarkably little for the final product.]]></description>

/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/core.jar

updating JDK to 1.8.  When I built I got a bad class file error on PApplet.  This occurred because My Mac has jdk 1.6 built in as the only SDK and Processing appears to be built with 1.8.  so go to Oracle: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html and download the 1.8 JDK (or whatever you need) and do a default install.

To configure SDKs at the global (IDE) level in intelliJ

Open the Project Structure dialog (e.g. ⌘;).
In the left-hand pane, under Platform Settings, click SDKs.
To add a new SDK, click add and select the desired SDK type.
In the dialog that opens, select the SDK home directory and click OK.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Margot,

If you haven&#039;t set up the JDK for IntelliJ (as I had not because I came from Ruby) you need to do that or you can&#039;t even create a JavaEE project.  The instructions you could reference in your article are at:

		<description><![CDATA[Kudos for this article!

Whereas I was there at the time of watching the movie, I had skipped reading this piece, thinking it wouldn&#039;t add anything.
I was dead wrong! You actually pointed things out I hadn&#039;t realised yet. And that doesn&#039;t happen very often. (Although Disney is making a habit of doing it this way, &#039;hiding&#039; little details and huge themes in a movie :)  )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#039;s all so recognizable! The first bit I experienced as well just a year ago. Just moved, everyone checking out the place, looking for things I didn&#039;t have (yet). And when I had them later on, there was still something wrong.

However, for me it already started a long time ago, consuming every bit of media possible and available. Started out as CDs, mostly downloaded back in the old days where my dad had to help me out with the huge process. Later on it was music on mp3 players and youtube videos. And now, it&#039;s just everywhere, all the time. My smartphone, and everyone else&#039;s for that matter, functions as mp3 player or even music streaming, plays all my favourite YouTube channels and displays every interesting article on gadgets and hardware. 
When at home, at &#039;work&#039; (Protopolis) and everywhere else, there&#039;s always music on. It&#039;s actually even without a choice, like music in stores. Sometimes it&#039;s only at night when there is complete silence. 
Up to the moment when my phone tells me there is a new video by Rhett&#038;Link, of course.]]></description>
